## Two Pin Passive Buzzer
Fixed pitch buzzer that buzzes when ever + PIN is held HIGH.  Can be found in misc small parts box.  There
are TWO small buzzers in the kit, one active and one passive.  The active has a seal around the pins while
the passive has metal showing around the pins.  This is what my passive buzzer's back looks like:

 There are TWO small buzzers in the kit, one active and one passive.  The active buzzer that I have has a 'sealed' back:

2-pin and 3-pin are coded the same.  There are two ways of coding the passive buzzers.  Both use the tone() function.

The first way simply turns on the tone at a set frequence (in Hz).
```
  constexpr long int ON_LENGTH = 1000;
  constexpr long int OFF_LENGTH = 1000;
  tone(BUZZER_PIN, 440);  // Turn on buzzer (440 Hz).  Returns immediately!
  delay(ON_LENGTH);       // let it run one second
  noTone();               // Turn off buzzer
  delay(OFF_LENGTH);      // Leave off for one second
```

The other way sets the tone duration in the call to tone() but still returns immediately.  Buzzer will turn off after ON_TIME, but if you wish a delay
before the next tone then the delay needs to be longer than the ON_TIME.
```
  constexpr long int ON_LENGTH = 1000;
  constexpr long int OFF_LENGTH = 1000;
  tone(BUZZER_PIN, 440, ON_LENGTH);  // Turn on buzzer (440 Hz).  Returns immediately!
  delay(ON_LENGTH + OFF_LENGTH);     // *total* time in loop is ON_TIME + OFF_TIME
```
